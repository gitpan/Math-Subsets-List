Math-Subsets-List version 1.006
===============================

Exports the function subsets() which generates all the subsets of a list
using the standard Perl metaphor. 

Please note that the order in which the subsets are generated is not
guaranteed, so please do not rely on it.

Standard Module::Build process for building and installing modules:

  perl Build.PL
  ./Build
  ./Build test
  ./Build install

Or, if you're on a platform (like DOS or Windows) that doesn't require
the "./" notation, you can do this:

  perl Build.PL
  Build
  Build test
  Build install
